RetrieverSafe

The purpose of this project is to promote campus safety and accessibility through features like instant access to emergency resources like police andd emergency lamp locations, calls to campus police for emergencies or safety escorts at night, and (maybe) sending your location to emergency contacts. There is a night mode to show lampost locations so you can plan your walking route through well lit areas on campus. It also has other options available to find handicap accessible routes, lactation rooms for nursing mothers, gender-inclusive bathrooms, and designated study spaces for commuters.
