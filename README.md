# RetrieverSafe

RetrieverSafe ensures campus safety and accessibility through features like instant access to emergency resources like police and emergency SOS phone locations, and calls to campus police for assistance such as requesting safety escorts at night, reporting suspicious behavior, or reporting a crime. The night mode and lamp locations help you plan your walking route through well lit areas on campus for additional security. RetrieverSafe also has accessibility options to help students find handicap accessible routes, lactation rooms for nursing mothers, family friendly restrooms for parents with children, and route closures due to construction. The family friendly restrooms and lactation rooms have additional information on the room and floors they are located in. Having access to all of the important locations and information in one web app reduces the time spent looking for the information that might not be as easy to find, and would be important in situations where time is essential.
